1. LLM

A large language model that generates text and answers.

2. Prompt

The instruction you give the model.

3. System Prompt

The hidden “rules” that control how the model behaves.

4. Prompt Engineering

Shaping prompts so the model gives the result you want.

5. Inference

The model producing an answer (this is what costs money).

6. Context Window

How much information the model can read at one time.

7. Embeddings

Numerical vectors that represent meaning for smart search.

8. Vector Database

A database used for semantic search powered by embeddings.

9. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

The model retrieves real documents first, then answers — helps avoid mistakes.

10. Hallucination

When the model confidently outputs something incorrect.

11. Grounding

Making the model answer only from real, verified data.

12. Guardrails

Safety rules that block bad, unsafe, or incorrect outputs.

13. Agent

An AI that can take multiple steps or use tools, not just answer.

14. Fine-Tuning

Training the model on your own examples to match your domain.

15. HITL (Human-in-the-Loop)

A human reviewing or approving AI outputs before they’re used.
